# inverted-flywheel-control-
This repository provides MATLAB code to explore control methods for an inverted flywheel, an underactuated system. Implemented controllers include PD (linear), LQR (optimal), MPC (predictive), and an Energy-Based swing-up strategy to ensure stability from far-from-equilibrium initial states.
